## üåü Introduction

This project is a modern, AI-driven web application designed to be the ultimate companion for Rubik's Cube enthusiasts. It leverages a powerful, custom-trained computer vision model to bridge the gap between a physical, scrambled cube and its digital solution. Users can simply present their cube to the application, and the AI pipeline will recognize the color configuration, query a solver API for the most efficient solution, and then teach the user the solution through an interactive 3D visualization.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **ü§ñ AI Vision Scanner:** Utilizes a custom computer vision model trained with **Roboflow** to accurately identify the location and color of each sticker from an uploaded image.
* **üí° External Solver API Integration:** Once the cube's state is determined, the application communicates with a dedicated API to fetch the optimal solving algorithm.
* **üéì Interactive 3D Tutorials:** The app renders your scrambled cube in a fully interactive **3D environment** and animates each move of the solution, allowing you to follow along at your own pace.
* **üìö Algorithm Library:** Explore a built-in library of common Rubik's Cube algorithms to deepen your understanding and improve your speed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies

| Technology | Role & Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **AI / Computer Vision** | A custom **Roboflow** model performs object detection and classification to read the cube's state. |
| **Solver API** | An external API provides the core solving logic, returning the optimal move sequence. |
| **3D Rendering** | The front-end uses 3D graphics to render the cube and animate the solution tutorial. |
| **Web App Framework** | Built as a modern, single-page web application. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Application Workflow

1.  **Image Upload:** The user provides images of the six faces of the scrambled cube.
2.  **AI Model Inference:** The custom **Roboflow** model is executed in the browser, returning the detected colors and their positions for each face.
3.  **State Reconstruction:** The application processes the detection results to build a complete digital representation of the cube's state.
4.  **API Solver Request:** The state string is sent to the external solving API.
5.  **Solution Reception:** The API responds with an optimized sequence of moves.
6.  **3D Visualization:** The initial scrambled state is rendered in **3D**, and the user can play through the received solution step-by-step.
